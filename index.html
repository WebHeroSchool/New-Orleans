          Solange Knowles recently moved<br>
          here from Brooklyn, and became<br>
          the creative director of this boutique<br>
          owned by her friends Lizzy<br>
          and Darlene Okpo and Armina Mussa.<br>
          Situated on a breezy side street in<br>
          the French Quater, Exodus Goods<br>
          feels like a secret you want to tell<br>
          everyone. With its mix of global and<br>
          New Orleans-based designers, the<br>
          store reflects the women's modern,<br>
          idiosyncratic style. Banana-leaf-<br>
          printed jumpsuits by Australian<br>
          brand Cameo the Label and neon-<br>
          tipped Brother Vellies deser boots<br>
          from Africa stand out against<br>
          the chipped walls and cement floors.<br>
          Local goods include Dvra pouches,<br>
          silk-screended with a pineapple<br>
          design, and a vetiver-based perfume<br>
          oil by Somoke. Since the colections<br>
          are samll, there is little chance you'll<br>
          see someone wearing the same<br>
          thingg-unless you happen to bump<br>
          into Solange and her crew out in the<br>
          Quarter.

                    Last November, Stirling Barrett opened a studio for<br>
                    his vintage-inspired eyewear brand, where he<br>
                    does fittings by appointment. The lightweight glasses<br>
                    come in a kaleidoscope of colours (eggplant, avocado,<br>
                    champagne) and are made of high-tch acetate<br>
                    that molds to your face so there's never slippage.<br>
